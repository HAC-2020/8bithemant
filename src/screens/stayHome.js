              Each day we hear about more people testing positive for COVID-19 in our county, the United States and throughout the world.

              The virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from person to person through droplets that are expelled into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. If you are nearby, these droplets can enter your body through the nose, mouth or lungs.

              Recent studies suggest that COVID-19 may be spread by people who show no symptoms, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That is why it is extremely important to take the necessary precautions to stop the spread of this virus.

                COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most
                infected people will develop mild to moderate symptoms.

              <ul className={classes.sympList}>
              <li>Avoid public spaces and social gatherings</li>
              <li>Stay at least 6 feet away from others if you must go out</li>
              <li>Wear a homemade cloth or fabric mask in public</li>
              <li>Don't attend or host gatherings</li>
              <li>Avoid mass transit</li>
              <li>Consider using delivery services for groceries, medications and other household items</li>

              To slow the spread of COVID-19 to a manageable level for hospitals and healthcare providers, Gov. Tom Wolf recently extended a stay-at-home order to all Pennsylvanians through April 30.

              The stay-at-home-order asks Pennsylvanians to refrain from non-essential travel. Essential travel includes commuting to and from an essential job, picking up groceries and medicine and checking on family and pets in other households, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Health.
